# Simple Inventory Management API (Node.js + PHP Template)

This is a simple Inventory Management RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB (Mongoose)**.  
It supports product management and inventory transaction tracking (sales, purchases, returns).  
Additionally, a PHP-based frontend template is available inside the `demo/` folder for testing and demonstration.
